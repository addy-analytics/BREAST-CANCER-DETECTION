## Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Background

### What is Breast Cancer
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells can invade and destroy surrounding tissues and can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. There are many types of cancer, each with its own characteristics and treatment options. Breast cancer specifically refers to cancer that starts in the cells of the breast. It can occur in both men and women, but it is far more common in women. Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast, such as the ducts, lobules, or the connective tissue. It can also be invasive or non-invasive.
  
Some common risk factors for breast cancer include age, gender, family history, certain gene mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), hormonal factors, reproductive history, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity. Globally, breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. 

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources, as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2022, here are some global statistics:
  
  - Incidence: In 2020, there were an estimated 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide.
  - Mortality: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women globally. In 2020, there were an estimated 685,000 deaths from breast cancer.
 
It's important to note that these numbers are subject to change as new data becomes available, and regional variations exist. Additionally, advancements in early detection and treatment have contributed to improved survival rates for breast cancer.
  For the most current and region-specific statistics, it's recommended to refer to reputable sources such as the World Health Organization, national cancer registries, or cancer research organizations.
  
Breast cancer affects men as well as women. Although it affects women more frequently than men, breast cancer can still strike men. However, the primary goal of this project will be to examine breast cancer in women. Still, a good deal of this material also applies to men.
